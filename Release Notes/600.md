- `CodeBlockSyntax`
  - Description: `CodeBlockSyntax` is now `SyntaxParseable`, so it can be used with string interpolations.
  - Pull Request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2361

- `ThrowsClause`
  - Description: The `throwsSpecifier` for the effects nodes (`AccessorEffectSpecifiers`, `FunctionEffectSpecifiers`, `TypeEffectSpecifiers`, `EffectSpecifiers`) has been replaced with `throwsClause`, which captures both the throws specifier and the (optional) thrown error type, as introduced by SE-0413.
  - Pull Request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2379

- `String.isValidIdentifier(for:)`
  - Description: `SwiftParser` adds an extension on `String` to check if it can be used as an identifier in a given context.
  - Pull Request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2434

- `MacroDeclSyntax.expand`
  - the `expand(argumentList:definition:replacements:)` method gains a new parameter 'genericReplacements:' that is defaulted to an empty array.
  - The method's signature is now `expand(argumentList:definition:replacements:genericReplacements:)`
  - Pull Request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2450

- `SyntaxProtocol.asMacroLexicalContext()` and `allMacroLexicalContexts(enclosingSyntax:)`
  - Description: Produce the lexical context for a given syntax node (if it has one), or the entire stack of lexical contexts enclosing a syntax node, for use in macro expansion.
  - Pull request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/1554

- `TriviaPiece.isComment`
  - Description: `TriviaPiece` now has a computed property `isComment` that returns `true` if the trivia piece is a comment.
  - Pull Request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2469

- New `assertMacroExpansion` API with option to specify macro specifications with `macroSpecs` argument
  - Description: `macroSpecs` can have additional specifications like conformances provided by member or extension macro that can be used for macro expansion.

  - Pull Request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2514

- `IncrementalEdit` stores replacement text
  - Description: `IncrementalEdit` used to store the range that was replaced and the length of the replacement but not the replacement bytes by itself. `IncrementalEdit` now has a `replacement` property that contains the replacement bytes.
  - Pull Request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2527

- Type specifiers
  - Description: `AttributedTypeSyntax` can now contain multiple specifiers and these types are used to model the list of specifiers. Additionally, type specifiers can now contain arguments, like `borrow(data)`. To facilitate this, the following new types were introduces: `LifetimeSpecifierArgumentListSyntax`, `LifetimeSpecifierArgumentSyntax`, `LifetimeSpecifierArgumentsSyntax`, `LifetimeTypeSpecifierSyntax`, `SimpleTypeSpecifierSyntax`, `TypeSpecifierListSyntax`
  - Pull request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2433

  - Pull Request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2539

- `ExprSyntax.interpretedAsVersionTuple`
  - Description: With the change to parse `#if canImport(MyModule, _version: 1.2.3)` as a function call instead of a dedicated syntax node, `1.2.3` natively gets parsed as a member access `3` to the `1.2` float literal. This property allows the reinterpretation of such an expression as a version tuple.
  - Pull request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2025

## API Behavior Changes

## Deprecations

- Child Choice Node Casts
  - Description: `is`, `as`, and `cast` methods for types not contained in the choice node are marked as deprecated. The deprecated methods will emit a warning, indicating that the cast will always fail.
  - Issue: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/issues/2092
  - Pull Request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2184
  - Migration steps: Remove the `is`, `as` or `cast` methods because they will always fail.

- `IncrementalParseTransition`:
  - Description: The initializer `IncrementalParseTransition.init(previousTree:edits:lookaheadRanges:reusedNodeCallback:)` is marked as deprecated. Use `IncrementalParseTransition.init(previousIncrementalParseResult:edits:reusedNodeCallback:)` instead.
  - Issue: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/issues/2267
  - Pull request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2272
  - Migration steps: Call `IncrementalParseTransition.init(previousIncrementalParseResult:edits:reusedNodeCallback:)` instead.

- `MacroExpansion{Error|Warning|FixIt}Message` moved to the `SwiftSyntaxMacros` module
  - Description: Move the `MacroExpansion{Error|Warning|FixIt}Message` types from the `SwiftSyntaxMacroExpansion` module to `SwiftSyntaxMacros`. Deprecated typealiases in `SwiftSyntaxMacroExpansion` forward to `SwiftSyntaxMacros`.
  - Pull request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2338
  - Notes: The expansion diagnostic messages were defined in `SwiftSyntaxMacroExpansion`, which is intended as an implementation detail of the plugin server and should not need to be imported by macros.

- `EditorPlaceholderDeclSyntax` and `EditorPlaceholderExprSyntax`:
  - Description: `EditorPlaceholderDeclSyntax` and `EditorPlaceholderExprSyntax` are now deprecated and placeholders are instead parsed as identifiers within a `MissingDeclSyntax` or `DeclReferenceExprSyntax`.
  - Pull request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2237

- `AttributedTypeSyntax.specifier` has renamed to `specifiers` and changed to be a collection
  - Description: Types can have multiple specifiers now and the syntax tree has been modified to reflect that.
  - Pull request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2433

- ` CanImportExprSyntax` and `CanImportVersionInfoSyntax`
  - Description: Instead of parsing `canImport` inside `#if` directives as a special expression node, parse it as a functionc call expression. This is in-line with how the `swift(>=6.0)` and `compiler(>=6.0)` directives are parsed.
  - Pull request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2025

## API-Incompatible Changes

- `MacroDefinition` used for expanding macros:
  - Description: The `MacroDefinition/expansion` enum case used to have two values (`(MacroExpansionExprSyntax, replacements: [Replacement])`), has now gained another value in order to support generic argument replacements in macro expansions: `(MacroExpansionExprSyntax, replacements: [Replacement], genericReplacements: [GenericArgumentReplacement])`
  - Pull request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2450
  - Migration steps: Code which exhaustively checked over the enum should be changed to `case .expansion(let node, let replacements, let genericReplacements):`. Creating the `.extension` gained a compatibility shim, retaining the previous syntax source compatible (`return .expansion(node, replacements: [])`).

- Effect specifiers:
  - Description: The `unexpectedAfterThrowsSpecifier` node of the various effect specifiers has been removed.
  - Pull request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2219
  - Migration steps: Check `unexpectedBetweenThrowsSpecifierAndThrownError` and `unexpectedAfterThrownError` instead.

- `SyntaxKind` removed conformance to `CaseIterable`
  - Description: `SyntaxKind` no longer conforms to `CaseIterable` since there is no good use case to iterate over all syntax kinds.
  - Pull request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2292
  - Migration steps: Exhaustively check all the syntax nodes that your program supports. There should be no use case to iterate over all cases in `SyntaxKind`.

- `IntegerLiteralExprSyntax.Radix` removed conformance to `CaseIterable`
  - Description: `IntegerLiteralExprSyntax.Radix` no longer conforms to `CaseIterable` since there is no good use case to iterate over all radix kinds.
  - Pull request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2292
  - Migration steps: There should be no use case to iterate over all cases in `IntegerLiteralExprSyntax.Radix`.

- `Parser.parseIncrementally(source:parseTransition:)` and `Parser.parseIncrementally(source:maximumNestingLevel:parseTransition:)`:
  - Description: The default versions of `Parser.parseIncrementally` return a `IncrementalParseResult` instead of a tuple. Access to the struct should be compatible with the tuple in almost all cases unless the tuple is stored into a variable and then destructed or passed to a function that expects a tuple.
  - Issue: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/issues/2267
  - Pull request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2272
  - Migration steps: If necessary, change type annotations from the tuple to the `IncrementalParseResult` type.

- `SyntaxClassification` gained a new case: `argumentLabel`
  - The new classification case covers the first names of parameters in function-like declarations and the label of arguments in function-like calls.
  - Pull request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2375
  - Migration steps: In exhaustive switches over `SyntaxClassification`, cover the new case.

- `SyntaxEnum` and `SyntaxKind` gained new cases: `throwsClause`
  - The new cases cover the newly introduced `ThrowsClauseSyntax`
  - Pull request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2379
  - Migration steps: In exhaustive switches over `SyntaxEnum` and `SyntaxKind`, cover the new case.

- `MacroExpansionContext` now requires a property `lexicalContext`:
  - Description: The new property provides the lexical context in which the macro is expanded, and has several paired API changes. Types that conform to `MacroExpansionContext` will need to implement this property. Additionally, the `HostToPluginMessage` cases `expandFreestandingMacro` and `expandAttachedMacro` now include an optional `lexicalContext`. Finally, the `SyntaxProtocol.expand(macros:in:indentationWidth:)` syntactic expansion operation has been deprecated in favor of a new version `expand(macros:contextGenerator:indentationWidth:)` that takes a function produces a new macro expansion context for each expansion.
  - Pull request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/1554
  - Migration steps: Add the new property `lexicalContext` to any `MacroExpansionContext`-conforming types. If implementing the host-to-plugin message protocol, add support for `lexicalContext`. For macro expansion operations going through `SyntaxProtocol.expand`, provide a context generator that creates a fresh context including the lexical context.

- `TriviaPiece.isBackslash` in `SwiftParserDiagnostics` removed
  - Description: `TriviaPiece.isBackslash` was not intended to be public API.
  - Pull request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2531
  - Migration steps: Use `if case .backslash = triviaPiece` instead
